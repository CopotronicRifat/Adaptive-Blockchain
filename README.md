# Adaptive Blockchain with Dynamic Difficulty and SJF Prioritization

## Overview

This repository explores **adaptive blockchain mechanisms** with an emphasis on dynamic difficulty adjustment and **Shortest Job First (SJF)** transaction prioritization. Developed as part of the CS5113 course at Oklahoma State University (Spring 2024), the project demonstrates improved throughput and performance by organizing transactions based on processing complexity.

## Core Contributions

- ‚úÖ Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on real-time mining statistics
- ‚úÖ Adaptive blockchain design with proof-of-work simulation
- ‚úÖ Shortest Transaction First model using a minimum priority queue
- ‚úÖ Comparative performance evaluation of SJF vs. standard adaptive chain
- ‚úÖ Queue length, average waiting time, and throughput analysis with plots

## Key Idea

By prioritizing **easy (low-cost)** transactions before **complex** ones using a **minimum priority queue**, the system:

- Reduces average waiting time
- Improves queue management under high loads
- Increases throughput compared to traditional adaptive models

## Mathematical Foundation

The system models transaction handling using balance equations, flow probabilities, and variable transaction arrival/service rates. The state transition diagram represents the sequential processing of easy ‚Üí complex transactions with probabilistic modeling and normalization for system equilibrium.

## Results (2024)

- Queue lengths (L) were lower in SJF across all process loads
- Average waiting time (W) significantly reduced in SJF under higher Œª
- Throughput (Œ≥) was surprisingly higher in SJF model despite initial assumptions
