# Adaptive Blockchain with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

## Overview

This repository presents an academic prototype of an **adaptive blockchain**, which includes dynamic difficulty tuning, proof-of-work simulation, and multiple experiments documented through notebooks and supporting materials.

The project was part of coursework and research on blockchain system behavior, mining efficiency, and network adaptability.

## Highlights

- ✅ Adaptive difficulty control based on mining time
- ✅ Proof-of-Work simulation
- ✅ Jupyter Notebooks for algorithm demonstration and improvements
- ✅ Documented design iterations and real-time simulation trials

## Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CopotronicRifat/Adaptive-Blockchain.git
cd Adaptive-Blockchain
```

2. Open the `.ipynb` files using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or JupyterLab.

3. Follow comments and cell-by-cell execution to understand each simulation and mining flow.

## Visualization

Simulations show block generation time, difficulty trends, and how mining adapts to changing workloads in each notebook.
